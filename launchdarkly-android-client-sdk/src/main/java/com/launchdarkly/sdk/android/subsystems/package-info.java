/**
 * Interfaces for implementation of LaunchDarkly SDK components.

 * Most applications will not need to refer to these types. You will use them if you are creating a
 * plugin component, such as a database integration. They are also used as interfaces for the built-in
 * SDK components, so that plugin components can be used interchangeably with those.
 * <p>
 * The package also includes concrete types that are used as parameters within these interfaces.
