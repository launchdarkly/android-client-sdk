# LaunchDarkly Android SDK proguard rules
#
# For more details, see https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code
#
# Basically, at a minimum we *must* include here:
#
# - Any class that will be serialized or deserialized with Gson. That is, if we are
# ever passing this class to Gson.fromJson() or Gson.toJson(), it must appear here.
# We do not need to include it if we are just using the Gson streaming API directly
# to read or write properties of that class, so that Gson itself does not actually
# interact with the class.
#
# - Any class that is referenced in Gson serialization-related annotations.
